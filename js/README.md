# Developing javascript juno-magic 

# Install

Note: Juno-magic currently relies on the `@timbr/react-machine` repo for its UI. In order to develop the JS locally you need to have the `timbr-omni` package locally, and then run 'npm link' in the `packages/react-machine` repo. 

1. `npm link @timbr/react-machine`
2. `npm install`
3. `python setup.py develop`
4. `jupyter notebook`
