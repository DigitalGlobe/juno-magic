# Developing javascript juno-magic 

# Install

Note: Juno-magic currently relies on the `@timbr/react-machine` repo for its UI. In order to develop the JS locally you need to have the `timbr-omni` package locally, and then run 'npm link' in the `packages/react-machine` repo. 

1. Run `npm install`
2. python setup.py develop
3. pip install .

# Usage 

After the installation is complete, you should be able to start a notebook and see the extension appear. 

```
jupyter notebook
```
